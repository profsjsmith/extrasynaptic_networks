JUPYTER notebook scripts and minor resource files used to generate Smith and Hawrylycz SfN 2024 “Homotypic Signaling” poster 
Stephen J Smith, 5 October 2024

This zip archive includes all scripts and minor resource files used to generate all data graphics displayed on a poster presented at the 2024 Chicago Society for Neuroscience meeting:
Abstract Control Number: 7308
Transcriptomic Evidence for Homotypic Neuropeptide Signaling Architectures in Mouse Brain
Stephen J Smith1,2, Michael J. Hawrylycz3;
1Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA; 3Modeling, Analysis, and Theory, 2Allen Inst., Seattle, WA
Session Number: PSTR148
Presentation Number: PSTR148.01
Session Title: Neuropeptides, Cytokines, Growth Factors, and Other Signaling Molecules
In-Person Presentation Time: Mon., Oct. 7, 2024 8 - 9 a.m Central

This archive is posted here in the interests of scientific rigor and thorough documentation. The present scripts are definitely NOT ready for easy “load and go” execution. Execution of any would require extensive expert environment configuration and download of numerous large, publicly available primary data files (as described in publications cited on the poster and also hinted in readmes in the present “Primary_scRNAseq_Data” sub-folder).
